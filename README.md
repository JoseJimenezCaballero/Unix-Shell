# Unix-Shell
A simple, efficient, Unix-shell with the ability to execute internal as well as external commands. It supports parrallelism as well as redirecting output to files.

Parrallelism: command1 args1 & command2 args2 will fork and execute in parallel both commands.

Redirect: Redirect output by adding > after the command followed by a file name. 

Built-In commands:

path: Changes the path the shell checks for programs

cd: Changes current directory

exit: Exits the shell
